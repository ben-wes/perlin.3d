# perlin.3d
3D perlin noise for Pure Data (Pd) - control rate input/output

Install by adding a folder `perlin.3d` with these files to one of pd's paths.
The abstraction `perlin.3d` expects the arguments:
* number of octaves
* persistance value
* (optional) `normalize` flag if you want to ensure that the sum of all octaves will not exceed 1
